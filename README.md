# Pasta-Bridge-Design-Lab
During my freshman year in college I built, designed, and tested a bridge made out of pasta for its strength to weight ratio. I worked in
a team and built and tested two bridges. After testing our bridge we then analyzed the testing data in Matlab to calculate the toughness. 

WHAT I LEARNED:
- Team work
- Iterative Design
- Using code to analyze data
- Matlab
- Autocad
